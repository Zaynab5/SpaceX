## üöÄ **Project Structure**  
### **1. Lab 1: Collecting the Data**  
- Collected data from the SpaceX REST API and additional public sources.  
- Used Python's `requests` library to make HTTP GET requests and extract key fields like `launch_date`, `payload_mass`, `orbit`, `launch_site`, and `success`.  
- Ensured structured data retrieval with high accuracy and minimal data loss.  
- **Goal:** Create a comprehensive dataset of SpaceX launch data for analysis.  

### **2. Lab 2: Finishing Web Scraping**  
- Performed web scraping using Python libraries `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests`.  
- Extracted additional information from SpaceX-related public websites and news sources.  
- Parsed HTML content to extract key insights about payloads, launch locations, and outcomes.  
- Cleaned and stored the extracted data using `Pandas`.  
- **Goal:** Supplement API data with external contextual data to improve analysis.  

### **3. Lab 3: Data Wrangling**  
- Cleaned and organized the dataset to prepare it for analysis and modeling.  
- Handled missing values using interpolation and mean-based imputation.  
- Removed duplicates and standardized data types (e.g., payload values converted to floats).  
- Created new features to improve model performance (e.g., payload categories, booster version).  
- **Goal:** Create a clean and structured dataset ready for analysis and modeling.  

### **4. Lab 4: SQL Notebook**  
- Performed SQL-based analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.  
- Created queries to analyze launch success rates, payload mass, and orbit-specific performance.  
- Grouped data by launch site and customer to identify consistent success patterns.  
- Provided foundational insights for subsequent visualizations and modeling.  
- **Goal:** Extract meaningful insights from structured data to support exploratory analysis.  

### **5. Lab 5: Exploring and Preparing Data**  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.  
- Created visualizations to explore the relationships between payload mass, orbit type, and success rate.  
- Found that lower payload masses correlated with higher success rates.  
- Discovered that certain orbit types (e.g., LEO) had consistently higher success rates.  
- **Goal:** Establish foundational insights to guide dashboard creation and modeling.  

### **6. Lab 6: Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium**  
- Developed an interactive map using `Folium` to visualize launch sites and success rates.  
- Plotted launch site markers and used different colors to represent successful and failed launches.  
- Added circles to represent launch site proximity to infrastructure (e.g., highways, coastlines).  
- Included trajectory lines to visualize flight paths.  
- **Goal:** Provide a geographic understanding of launch outcomes and site-specific performance.  

### **7. Lab 6 Part 2: Plotly Dash App**  
- Built an interactive dashboard using `Plotly Dash` to analyze payload and launch success.  
- Added a dropdown to filter by launch site and a range slider to adjust payload mass.  
- Created a pie chart to display success rates by site and a scatter plot to show payload-success correlation.  
- Ensured real-time updates based on user input.  
- **Goal:** Provide an intuitive interface for exploring launch success patterns dynamically.  

### **8. Lab 7: Machine Learning Prediction**  
- Developed and compared several classification models:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - Gradient Boosting  
- Used `GridSearchCV` to tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.  
- Best model: **Random Forest** with ~87% accuracy.  
- Handled class imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).  
- Evaluated performance using:  
   - Accuracy ‚Äì Percentage of correct predictions.  
   - F1 Score ‚Äì Balance between precision and recall.  
   - Confusion Matrix ‚Äì Identified false positives/negatives.  
- **Goal:** Build a high-performance predictive model for launch success.  

## üìà **Results and Insights**  
### **Exploratory Analysis Insights:**  
- Success rates were highest for low-payload launches, especially for payloads under **4,000 kg**.  
- Specific launch sites (e.g., **KSC LC-39A** and **CCAFS SLC-40**) consistently outperformed others.  
- Orbit type and payload mass were the most influential factors for success:  
   - Low Earth Orbit (LEO) had the highest success rates due to lower energy requirements.  
   - High orbits (e.g., GEO) had lower success rates due to more complex launch conditions.  
- Success rate increased significantly after **2015** due to improvements in rocket design and reusable boosters.  
- Higher flight numbers (experience) were correlated with higher success rates.  

### **Dashboard Insights:**  
- Interactive dashboard confirmed that payload mass and orbit type are key success drivers.  
- Drop-down and slider allowed for real-time exploration of site-specific performance and payload correlations.  
- Success rates for low-payload launches were notably higher, consistent with the model‚Äôs findings.  
- Successful launches were more frequent from **KSC LC-39A** and **VAFB SLC-4E**.  

### **Machine Learning Insights:**  
- Best Model: **Random Forest** ‚Äì Achieved 87% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning.  
- Model identified payload mass, orbit type, and launch site as the most important predictors.  
- Confusion Matrix showed high true positive and true negative rates with minimal false negatives.  
- High F1 score indicated that the model balanced precision and recall effectively.  

### **Strategic Insights:**  
- Predicting landing success allows SpaceX to estimate future launch costs more accurately.  
- Identifying the best-performing launch sites and payload categories enables better resource allocation.  
- Success rate improvements post-2015 demonstrate the value of reusable rocket technology.  
- The model‚Äôs ability to predict success with high accuracy enables operational and cost optimizations.
